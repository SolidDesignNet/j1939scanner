# j1939scanner

This tool is a simple J1939 scan tool.  J1939DA is not embedded.  You should purchase a copy of J1939DA_MAR2021.xlsx from SAE.

**STATUS: pre-initial release.  I'm still getting the foundation down.**

Currently, the tool opens a hardcoded RP1210 device, collects packets onto a broadcast channel, logs them from another thread, loads the J1939DA and displays a table with searching and sorting.

Next steps:
1. Allow user to select RP1210 driver and save in preferences.
2. Allow user to select J1939DA location and save in preferences.
3. Make initial release build.
4. Fault table.
5. On Request signals.

## Building
j1939scanner uses RP1210 as the CAN adapter.  RP1210 requires 32 bit.

1. Use rust toolchaing stable-i686-pc-windows-gnu.

2. install the msys2 32 bit GTK libraries:
From: https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk/issues/494

Install rust with rustupâ€‘init.exe (as script in console install to "C:\users\USER" anyway)
with i686-pc-windows-gnu/stable/yes
Install MSYS2 from http://www.msys2.org
I do use link different from http://gtk-rs.org/docs-src/requirements.html as sourceforge.net asked login
Added PATH="/c/Users/${USER}/.cargo/bin:${PATH}" to C:\MSYS32\home\USER\.bash_profile
In MSYS2 MSYS 32 bit console
```
pacman -S git
pacman -S mingw-i686-gtk3  // double check "i686" for 32 bit
pacman -S mingw-i686-toolchain
default parameters  // WHAT IS THIS?!
```
In MSYS2 MinGW 32-bit console
#check that gtk installed property
`pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0`

```
git clone https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples/
cd examples
cargo build
cargo run --bin basic
```
